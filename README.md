## Introduction üìã

GasGuard tackles the inefficiencies in gas management, such as:
- Difficulty in **monitoring gas levels** accurately.
- Lack of **predictions** for gas consumption patterns.
- Unexpected gas depletion causing disruptions.
- Wastage of energy and increased costs.

### Key Objectives:
- Provide **real-time monitoring** of gas levels using IoT sensors.
- Use **AI-powered analytics** to predict days remaining for gas usage.
- Send timely **refill notifications** and consumption tips.
- Promote energy savings and sustainability.
